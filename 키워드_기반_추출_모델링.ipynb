I brought the issue to the waitresses attention and nothing was done to fix the issue. Overall a not so great experience. The fries & gravy were tolerable, but not enough for us to return. I definitely do not recommend this establishment. My wife and I had some time to spare before going to the Royal Alex hospital so we decided on Humpty\\'s just across the street at 9AM. My wife ordered the waffle and I had the Canadian skillet. Coffee was plentiful. Orders arrived after 12 minutes which was ok considering the place was only about 1/4 full. Waffle topped with overly sweet whipped cream and some strawberries. I had a full skillet but 3/4 were potatoes. Couldn\\'t really tell how many eggs were in the skillet as there was a very unusual and off tasting yellow sauce. Needed a magnifying glass to find the bacon. I left 1/2 of the skillet for the kitchen staff. 15 minutes later I had to dash for the bathroom.....not pretty! Humpty\\'s firmly on our blacklist. Lunchtime while visiting a family member at the hospital.\\n\\nThe exterior and interior is rundown.\\nDrug use action just outside the front door.  Management does not care.\\nPan scrambler was not good.   Burnt eggs smothered in 7 Eleven nacho cheese.  \\nCabin stack sandwich tasted okay however portion size was not indicative of the price or menu photo.  Practically no meat and very small to begin with.   Side salad tasted like dirty bitter lettuce.\\n\\nDon\\'t be stupid enough to eat here is.  It is expensive and crappy.   Just eat at the cafeteria. My friends and myself came to humpty\\'s to have a nice breakfast and it was horrid and a disaster. the service was fine, the food was DESPICABLE. My friend ordered the \"chicken louie\" the mashed potatoes tasted like acid reflux and the chicken was so rubbery she couldn\\'t eat half of it. The ground beef in the \"Mexican scrambler\" was questionable too. My other friend ordered the \"crunchy chicken parmesan\" the pasta was watery and definitely unappealing and the vegetables were cold and clearly frozen. we all feel sick.'"

I like the fact that it is on paper and you don't have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want. The sushi bowl was good but not wonderful. The choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and I felt I had more rice than other food items. The sauces were tasty. My husband ordered the Maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard. It was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street. I would go back though and I think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls. I do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service. People - it is a sushi place - it isn't McDonalds- so it will be a bit slower. You are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express. As a healthy alternative to fast food in the area, it is worth the wait. Oh and try the bubble tea.

The headed shrimp were large and tasty. All the items were precooked, obviously. The fish spread was decent , also had the Fried Shrimp and Shrimp scampi  which were decent. BYOB ... ... The atmosphere was nice except for the zillion Flies. I'll be back with a six pack Absolutely fantastic!!!!  I'll be back for sure. Fried lobster tail was delicious. Five star for sure. I was sadly disappointed in my experience. We ordered crabs and they were extremely small, watery and over half were bad(sick crabs), we ordered beans and rice which lacked flavor and literally had one bean in it that you can see from the picture. The coleslaw also lacked taste. We ask for grouper nuggets and a few were not cooked all the way. So given the food experience it was nothing like the reviews we read. Why I am giving them three stars is because the waitress that waited on us (young pregnant girl) was EXTREMELY polite and an excellent server. The owner came by our table and greeted us which is something not done often these days. They also took half off the crabs since half were bad trying to make it right but in the end we paid over $50 (including tip) for food that we barley ate and had to go to McDonald's after. \n",

Great place for group of friends to meet & eat the freshest seafood in New Port Richie!  Friendly and very casual!   The chef answered questions and made great recommendations!   Servings were very generous with a really good slaw!  Pricing very reasonable considering the quality and portions!   We will come back again.  The menu changes with the daily catch so we will try the next new thing Frankie cooks up! Blown away how fun and awesome this little gem is! The atmosphere is so fun and festive and the garlic shrimp and fried lobster to die for! Cannot wait to go back and get some blue crabs steamed Baltimore style!!! It was a cold night but the heaters were perfect. It's BYOB which is also the bomb.com Never would have thought a little hidden place like this would have such great food! We had oysters garlic shrimp and crab cakes and everything was amazing ! It was so good I forgot to take pictures before I devoured everything! Will definitely be back ! Finale a local Fresh seafood place to go to. Had the top neck clams & crabs. Great job guys. Thanks see you again with our corona 6 pack. EVERYTHING we had on this menu was amazing . The stone crab claws are a must try, the sweet plantains, the garlic butter shrimp. All delicious. Service was awesome , just a nice laid  back place and you can BYOB. Our server annmarie was attentive and friendly. We met the owner Frankie and his family who were personable, friendly and went out of their way to make sure our daughter Bella had a great experience. Definitely will be back :) Be careful before ordering the coleslaw, I found a rusted push pin in mine. When I showed it to the waitress she apologized and said it came from the board above where food is prepared. Just thankful that I did not eat the pin, can't image the internal damage it could have done.  I was offered a free desert but passed on that. Don't know if I would go back. Unfortunately the site for Frankie's is incorrect on hours. When I called and got no answers assumed they were closed. Frankie call me back to say they were in fact open! That never happens so we went and found a diamond in the rough and a fantastic fresh seafood eatery. Joe the chef is a super nice guy and even better cook. Had ridiculously fresh oysters, fish dip, and lobster meal that rivaled the best we ever tasted. It's a byob, which I love also. We are only in Port Richey for a couple days but will likely eat there the rest of our evenings. Get there before everyone finds out and the wait is in the hours! Well done Frankie and thanks for bringing us in! What a fantastic casual seafood or BBQ local secret. No frills just amazing food. It was the best oysters I've had in decades. This location is right of of state road 54.\n",

I brought the issue to the waitresses attention and nothing was done to fix the issue. Overall a not so great experience. The fries & gravy were tolerable, but not enough for us to return. I definitely do not recommend this establishment. My wife and I had some time to spare before going to the Royal Alex hospital so we decided on Humpty's just across the street at 9AM. My wife ordered the waffle and I had the Canadian skillet. Coffee was plentiful. Orders arrived after 12 minutes which was ok considering the place was only about 1/4 full. Waffle topped with overly sweet whipped cream and some strawberries. I had a full skillet but 3/4 were potatoes. Couldn't really tell how many eggs were in the skillet as there was a very unusual and off tasting yellow sauce. Needed a magnifying glass to find the bacon. I left 1/2 of the skillet for the kitchen staff. 15 minutes later I had to dash for the bathroom.....not pretty! Humpty's firmly on our blacklist.

My friend ordered the \"chicken louie\" the mashed potatoes tasted like acid reflux and the chicken was so rubbery she couldn't eat half of it. The ground beef in the \"Mexican scrambler\" was questionable too.

            "Took me for 40 bucks through grubhub, no call no show, said they got my order, and it never came, no phone call, no email. Not sure if its grubhubs fault. Either way no way to run a business. Place is nice and bathrooms are clean. There's a hand washing station. Pretty neat. Had the Caesar salad, garlic bbq wings, and plain wings. Food was good. Caesar had a little too much cheese but I I'll never complain about that. Lol. Only negative is they have a nice bar area, but don't serve liquor, as they don't have a license. Overall a nice joint. Quite dissappointed in this location.  The kitchen staff and take-out cashier had two verbal altercations while I waited for my spinach sandwich.  The sandwich had potential had the actually put spinach on it.  Each half ( at least 5 inches of bread,) had 4 leaves of spinach, so it was pretty much a bread sandwich! My friends and I were staying at NOLA for the weekend to run the Rock n Roll half marathon and ordered delivery. Fantastic! I had the lasagna which was very cheesy and creamy. My friends had the calzone and stuffed pizza. We stuffed ourselves and had enough for lunch the next day. Lunch special are greatly priced with excellent portions. I always grab the Greek gourmet pizza with and Italian salad. Speedy service, servers are always friendly. We went on a Saturday afternoon and had the place to ourselves. Service was friendly and prompt. Food was quick, hot, and yummy. Do yourself a favor and order the garlic bread! They were out of several soda options, besides that we had no complaints. This was our first visit, we brought our daughter out to dinner. It was 5:30pm and we were the only customers. Our table was dirty but we ordered drinks anyways. When we ordered, my daughter requested alfredo pasta but they were out. No big deal. We ordered our meals and about 10 minutes later the waitress told us that they were out of what my husband and I ordered. She did not know why they were out of things. At that point we paid for our drinks and left. I don't know what is going on with this place but they got my order wrong and never delivered the rest of it. After many phone calls I couldn't get them to refund me - only give me a credit. Something is sketchy here The Original Italian Pie is an all time favorite.  This place is affordable and kid friendly.  The pizza and the Shrimp pasta ties for my favorite.  The Cheesy bread is also a fave. New staff is needed! I preordered my food and was told 10 minutes. Gave it 15 to be safe. I arrive, oh for my food and sit... for an additional 15 minutes. Mind you, I can see my food bagged and ready to go. I know what I ordered will now be soggy and inedible so I request a refund. The owner was very sweet and accommodating but her employees had no concern for customers whatsoever. I was starving and now my lunch break is over and I have no food. My last time coming here. I'm tired of giving chances to undeserving businesses. We just had a to-go order delivered via Uber Eats. The salad was missing the breadsticks it said it came with, and the dressing was beyond disgusting. If that's the \"signature\" dressing, you might want to rethink it. My husband's wings were missing the sauce. We've given this location several tries (both dine-in and to go) as we're in the neighborhood, but never again! Fresh ingredients on my shrimp Florentine calzone....it was delicious. I wish I would have ordered two! Horrible and overpriced. I can't believe they even call this pizza. It was tough as cardboard, sauce and cheese weren't any better. Would have rather had a frozen Digiourno or Totinos Pizza. If you are in a pinch and really want pizza, skip this and just go to one of the national pizza chains. The lasagna is excellent and homemade! We also love the all meat pizza. The selling factor for me ordering from this location is their ability to deliver through UberEats. We order from this location at least twice per week. My brother and his family came into town and The Original Italian Pie catered food for their visit. Everyone was pleased with the food. Food is generally pretty good but service rarely is.  Sometimes music is played too loud to have a conversation.  Recently they were out of mozzarella sticks. I didn't even know that could happen at an Italian restaurant. I needed pretty quick delivery to the hotel and waited over an hour and a half for this calzone. Funny enough It has a great consistency, and a decent meatball filling, but the dough has no taste, nothing, I can't even explain what that feels like. Don't waste your money on the salad, does that look like a $4 'Caesar'? So this was entirely through GrubHub leaving no contact with staff or opinion on decor but the ridiculous order time? That was all their fault. It was steaming hot when it arrived letting me know GrubHub did their job well. Never even got to try the food. Ordered food via GrubHub. I still had not received it half an hour after the expected delivery time. I called the restaurant and they stated that the GrubHub driver had left with the food approximately ten minutes before. I waited an additional 30 minutes before calling GrubHub to ask the whereabouts of their driver. GrubHub informed me that the restaurant used their own delivery drivers, not GrubHub drivers. When I called the restaurant back and confronted them about having told me that this was GrubHub's fault, the guy on the phone replied that he \"had food to make\" and hung up on me. \n",

They have the most variety of toppings and fro yo . The place is always clean and the staff is super friendly! I highly recommend this place Our favorite frozen yogurt because the flavors are amazing and the topping choices can't be beat! Delicious! Just a average yogurt shop.

It took the wind out of our excitement to come and enjoy an ice cream after a nice dinner. First time there today. They have great flavors but went there for the many options of toppings! Such a huge variety and delicious. I noticed they work to be it clean too. Friendly and helpful worker. 5 stars because I love the yogurt & the staff... but I really hope the owner reads this: INVEST IN GLASS MASON JARS TO KEEP YOUR TOPPINGS FRESH & TASTING NATURAL. Every single item I put on my yogurt taste like a ziplock bag. You know why? Because you have your employees BAG all of it at the end of the night!! Sick dude. No excuse for running a business like that, seriously. Get with it.. you know what happens when you have great tasting toppings??? Your customers will actually enjoy them... & load up on them... making their yogurt heavier when they are checking out... You know what that means? MONEY! No need to worry about the cost of mason jars right?!? Hmmm food for thought..... One of the worst yogurt shops i have ever been to. When we walked up to the door we wondered if they were even open. No one was inside- not customers, nor the cashiers. The door was open, so we went in.\n",

When I finally settled on watermelon and a safe vanilla combo- I thought i might be in for an end of summer treat. I topped it with gummy bears and some mini m&ms. The yogurt came out of the dispenser very watery and melted into liquid immediately when it hit my bowl. As we made it to the cash register to pay-- the sleepy eyed  cashier finally came out from the back. Boy- what an attitude. We no doubt woke the princess up from her nap. Nope, no prince charming tonight- just us two older ladies hoping for a bite of a cool treat. \n",

I use the original tart flavor as a bellwether, and their California tart did not disappoint. The Irish cream was delightfully not too sweet with a bit of texture, the triple chocolate was divine, and the sea salt caramel was exquisite - and I do not like caramel in general. They have an extensive and tidily kept topping bar, and the service was terrific.

I'm certainly glad that they're not the only grocery store company in town.... Always clean, organized well staffed. Their staff is friendly and always willing to help. The only reason I don't give 4 stars is their deli and bakery is not that impressive. Also want to include their florist area as well in that needs improvement category. Compared to Publix they are a pale comparison. Other than those things this is my favorite grocer and go here at least once a week. Beer and wine isle is packed with everything especially local beers. Pharmacy is efficient and professional. Overall love this place I make every effort not to shop here. This business uses some questionable practices and have some questionable policies considering customers with color. About one month ago, my husband and I go to buy some apples. I make sure to pick the gala apples because they were less expensive. I get to the cash register and the cashier charges me for honey crisp apples which cost $1.50 more per apple. I explain to the cashier the price of the apples I had chosen and she calls her manager to confirm the price. I have never had that happen at Publix or even Walmart, as the customer, I am right at any other business I go to because I AM THE CUSTOMER. The manager comes back confirms the cashier was correct to charge me for apple crisp apples. Also she states that the gala apples aren't even out. I pay, walk back to produce take a picture and pull off the sign that states gala apples. All of which the cashier could not be bothered to do. I get back in line with my proof to get my money back. Again, the cashier cannot give refunds so I, the customer has to go find the manager. The same one who insinuated that I was stealing. Obviously annoyed, I approach the manager with my evidence.  Of course when approached with the undeniable proof, she refunds my money but not before she blamed the produce manager. She explained that she asked and that's what the produce manager told her. Readers, I did mention it was a sign posted, right? Also, I AM A CUSTOMER, why would she think it was professional to complain about one of her employees to me. Well, I believe it was because the Caucasian gentlemen (or appeared to be) behind just told the cashier of the price and it was fixed. On a separate occasion, there was an accident on Big Bend Road so I was forced into going to Winn Dixie. I had the very same issue with the price gouging of apples. Gala apples were mixed in with another brand and I was charged the higher amount. This time, I was prepared with pictures of the price sticker and pictures of the apple bins. The staff certainly needs training on customer service and how to approach their own personal bias. Parking is good and the store is clean but customer service and pricing policies need help! Go to another store if at all possible. The pharmacy of this Winn-Dixie at Big bend Road is not good. The major problems were: 1. When making appointment on website, every insurance information have been filled in. But the pharmacy still needs to re-fill out the same question form again that was wasting time. 2. The female India-American Pharmacist is very rude, and not like other medical service persons' kind should be. Not very much selection wise! Checkout only has like 10 lanes and only three are open. Slow slow slow! Although the store is clean! We really enjoy going to Winn-Dixie, and this is a very clean location. The Prices and Meat Quality are huge pluses for them over their competitors. The company leaves them understaffed but they do a great job at a very good location all things considered.\n",

The problem with this is not only are they restricting their breathing which is their prerogative.(not smart). BUT they are constantly touching their masks and then touching all the food that we as consumers are purchasing to eat. When masks are worn they soak up saliva, mucus and bacteria. They are EXTREMELY unsanitary! This madness needs to stop. I hope that the word gets back to management and they stop being fearful of getting a cold. \n",

Very friendly and the service is fast. SANDWICH SEASON is coming up people. Go check out this shop. You taste buds and stomach will thank you. So this was just fine, but didn't quite live up to the five-star average. I had an Italian hoagie.

The few times I ordered party trays, the crowd really liked the hoagies and asked where I got them from.  Very pleased. Chris is a small restaurant that has your typical pizza / sandwich options.

Still waiting......oh and the cashier had hickey's all over her neck. One of the best authentic bagel houses. It is a little on the pricey side but if you want really really delicious bagels, this is the place to go to. \n",
            "\n",
            "We had breakfast where we tried a spinach/egg/cheese on an everything bagel as well as the Lox on an onion bagel. Both were really tasty and freshly prepared. Lox comes with a heavy dose of cream cheese so be prepared for that. The capers in the Lox sandwich give it a really nice kick. The chai tea latte was OK, probably won't get it again. Hashbrowns are a little greasy.\n",
            "\n",
            "They also sell bagels by the Baker's dozen, half dozen, or individually. They provide freezer bags if you want to save for later.\n",

            "Parking can be cramped especially on weekend mornings but they offer additional parking in rear. This place is the worst. We've gone there a number of times based on convenience and the fact that they have decent food, but they have gotten our orders wrong more than half of the time. Will not be going back, no matter how convenient it is. Again...pulled up today at 2:40 when they close at 3 and the open sign is on. Walk up and the door is locked and the girl flips off the open sign right in front of me. Lolololol. I served tables for 11 years and that's a no no In the industry. First time coming here after not coming for 6 months because of bad service. What a taste that left.... My significant other and I LOVE ourselves some Manhattan Bagel. We recently moved to Willow Grove from Northwest Philadelphia where the one in our neighborhood left much to be desired. We joked about the not  so happy staff, but then started coming to this location and let's just say this staff makes the staff in Philly look like the kids from the Sound of Music. Every time we walk in the staff almost groans with having to speak to a customer. The manager is friendly but his staff is absolutely miserable. We frequent here, and even as someone who has worked in food service for 10+ years and tips a dollar on just coffee alone, don't ever expect a smile or thank you from this staff. The woman at the register makes going in there a dread of an experience and is so rude. If you ask for a bagel they are out of they literally shoot daggers at you with their eyes, roll their eyes, and almost berate you for trying to choose a bagel you didn't know they were out of. Which how would I know since they put all the bagels away at 2:00 PM when they close at 3PM because they are trying to jet out of there. The chairs are already turned around and on top of the tables at 2. It's honestly the worst because we love the food but every time we go in and try to be friendly we leave feeling horrible at the customer service we just DID NOT receive. I know the treatment food service workers are put through. I try to be the sweetest and most easy going customer, but these people simply are terrible and make me feel awful for even trying to order a darn bagel! Pretty pricey for breakfast sandwiches. You will easily drop $20 or more for two people for little breakfast sandwiches and beverages. The parking lot is super small,awkward shaped,difficult to get in and out of. They have weird hours that seem to change often. Inside is a bit cramped and there's a few super tiny tables  that are lined up against the wall next the where people wait in line. So if you want to dine in you have to have someone's butt in your face while you eat. Today, at around 4:40 pm I decided I would commit to the 35 minute commute to my local Manhattan Bagel for dinner  since I hadn't had it in a long time and I really wanted it. Prior, I had checked the Manhattan Bagel website for the hours, as well as google and it said 6 pm, which would give me plenty of time. To my dismay, after driving 35 minutes and arriving, this location was closed and had posted on their door that they close at 3 pm. I wouldn't mind them closing at 3 pm otherwise, however I was annoyed that this was not what was depicted on their website. If I had known this, I wouldn't have made the drive. This miscommuncation was very frustrating and needs to be fixed. We came here today on Nov. 23 thanksgiving 2017 and we expected to come and have great service as usual. As we were ordering our cashier Taylor was rude cussing under her breath and rolling her eyes as we were ordering. They took 45 mins to make 2 sandwiches and a bagel. It wasn't busy and it wasn't even close to closing. The workers making the food were cussing and freaking out about 3 small tickets. They also messed up our to lattes they were not even hot with no flavor and no whipped cream that we asked for. I don't think me and my boyfriend will be coming here again. Came here because I received a gift card for xmas. I always wanted to come here but the parking lot looked weird and hard to get into as well as out. I was correct about the parking lot and it didn't help that there was a snow storm a few days before and has piles of snow that doesn't make parking any easier. But the food is a different story! I ordered the Empire State Club on Spinach and cheese bagel and ordered a Bakers Dozen with two cream cheese for my family. \n",
            "\n",
            "Empire State Club on Spinach and cheese bagel!! OMG IM IN LOVE!! I loved this! and I will definitely come back just for this. I forget how much this is but I will pay for it. LOL It taste was great it wasn't dry and the Spinach and cheese bagel was so delicious.\n",
            "\n",
            "I ordered the Bakers Dozen with two cream cheese and the bagels were big and were tasty. I also got to choose the cream cheeses but I just played it safe and got two regular cream cheeses. My family loved them and asked me to buy this more often. I will definitely come back! Stopped in Wed and took advantage of their $3.50 bagel/cream cheese and coffee combo.  The bagels here are probably the smallest I have ever seen.  The cream cheese was good and a very healthy portion.  Wish the bagels were bigger and there was a larger selection of cookies and other sweets.  There were quite a few muffins, but limited selection of other sweets.\n",

            "Coffee was good and both hot and cold are self service options.\n",
            "Place has somewhat of an Einstein's Bagel vibe to it, even some of the fonts and layout of signage looked similar.\n",

            "Worth coming back again, maybe need to get two bagels next time. Amazing food! clean and fast service can't wait to come back. Everyone here is super nice and make sure the meal comes out correctly. They are always behind even if there is 10 people working and 3 customers. They always take the phone off the hook. The last 2 times I went in the pretended they didn't know and the other time told me it was dead and they didn't know. Quality of food has dropped drastically in the last few months Ordered a whitefish bagel. Missing completely. Ordered three with Turkey bacon. Got regular. Literally can't eat ANYTHING like, nothing, and was told to file a claim with Uber eats. WOW. Ok. At least my neighbors get some bagels! It's franchise bagels that are better than average as as those from a grocery store. Orders are rarely ever ready on time, and sometimes they aren't even aware of your order, leaving the staff frazzled and backed up. The prices on beverages and sandwiches are overpriced. There's no other competitors in the area and their location is prime. Called in an order to take brunch for my mom. Unfortunately the manager was on vacation, which seemed to leave chaos in the kitchen, and when I got to my mom's place, the sandwiches were literally empty inside! Whitefish salad ordered for both, but none on either one. See photos.\n",
            "\n",
            "The manager made good on it the next week. She personally made me two huge sandwiches (we could've shared one) and didn't charge for either one. They also had credited my card for the empty sandwiches received a week earlier. So that manager fixed a negative situation.\n",
            "\n",
            "On the plus side, the whitefish salad is kick ass, and their bagels are light and delicious. I also like that they put toppings on both sides of the bagel, not just on the top. This is definitely my go to place for picking up a bagel when I go to see my mom! What a grouch!! Lady was very rude, arrogant and unprofessional, no customer service skills, bad attitude, won't be returning there I'll stick to Panera Bagel is great! Crispy outside soft chewy inside... the service and cleanliness of the place is lacking. Not sure if I will come back. \n",

            "Really excited to get healthier options on the Circle! Got a wrap and it was delicious and HUGE. Definitely two meals for me, so when you take that into account its a good price to. Would love to be able to order just half though, not sure if thats an option or not. Chips were meh. Tried Green District today. Amazing. Highly recommend for a healthy alternative to fast food downtown. Green District Salads makes going to the office a little more fun. :) It has been my go-to lunch place recently and it has never let me down. I'm a huge fan of the Blue Barrymore. All of their salads taste fresh and are big enough to satisfy my hunger for the entire afternoon. I also got a salad delivered and it tasted just as good as picking it up in-store. \n",
            "\n",
            "If you download the app, you can get $5 off your first salad! Fresh ingredients and options! I was really impressed by the size of the salad and the variety of toppings to choose from. The prices were very reasonable too for the quality and quantity of them. Definitely recommend it if you're looking for a great salad! Fresh ingredients and large portions (I built my own wrap). It was delicious. So happy to have them downtown! I got a free salad/bowl/wrap coupon through my work, and chose to build my own salad. I'm pretty picky when it comes to my salads so I'm glad I could have it made the way I like it. It was delicious! The restaurant was incredibly clean and the service was awesome. A worker came up to ask how everything was which was really nice! There is plenty of seating indoors and outdoors. Overall really enjoyed my experience definitely go! My friend raved about Green District, so I had to try it out. Located right on Monument Circle, you can expect lunch rush - but they have an app where you can order & pickup, and receive reward points. \n",
            "\n",
            "The menu is huge with a number of preset salad options, or you can build your own. You can get the dressing mixed up or on the side. I got the Spinach Inquisition and really enjoyed it, the goat cheese gave this a really nice flavor.\n",
            "\n",
            "They have 4 drink options, sweet tea (with lemon), lemonade, black tea, and blackberry tea. The lemonade was pretty good. I just started working downtown again and I am so glad this place is nearby! I ordered hours ahead online to pick up at noon; I did a build your own wrap (awesome choices) and some hummus / pita chips for a snack later. You get $5 off your first order! My food was ready as soon as I got there at noon at the online order pick up spot. \n",
            "\n",
            "The wrap and hummus were great! The hummus is a pretty decent size for a \"side\" and you get an individual bag of pita chips. I also ordered their blackberry tractor tea which was so yummy. \n",
            "\n",
            "I will be a regular here, I can already tell! Let's hope they don't have the downtown restaurant curse like others recently; there's hardly any food options anymore. I have been waiting for something like this to open in downtown Indy for awhile & it did not disappoint! The staff was very welcoming & kind. The food was fresh & fast. I've ordered both off the menu & created my own wrap. 10/10 would recommend. I love this place!! I will say, I am not someone who really ever spends money on salads when I go out to eat. But this is worth it!! You start with your base (I did half quinoa half spinach) and then add toppings, which they have A LOT to choose from. You can add a protein and then a sauce. I relied on the worker a lot for recommendations as it was my first time in. I wanted a quinoa grain bowl type thing, and he did a great job with his recommendations! I ended up with shrimp and honey mustard on top. It was huge- I definitely did not think I was going to eat it all for lunch, but ended up finishing it because it was so good!! \n",
            "\n",
            "My absolute favorite thing about this whole experience was that once you are done building your salad, they dump it out on a big cutting hoard and chop it all up, mix it up, and pour it back in your bowl. No more forkfuls of entirely spinach or entirely toppings- it is perfectly mixed and chopped already!! I never realized how much I needed this for every salad I eat. \n",
            "\n",
            "They also have fancy sodas and good looking drinks- I wish I had known before checking out. I will definitely have to get a beverage next time I am in. \n",
            "\n",
            "This location is right on the circle- so plan your parking accordingly. It was not crazy busy when I went- on a weekday for lunch. There was seating inside but I took it to go. \n",

I was super impressed with their service and quality.\n",

I really appreciated this!\n",

Really good selection of items on the menu but the build-your-own is what got my attention.

            "Every time we come here, the wonderful people working here are helpful, kind, and provide excellent customer service! 99 times out of 100, they'll screw your order up. The employees just don't give a shit. My most recent experience, which was about 5 minutes ago was the last straw. I went at six pm. There was one other car in front of me and no one inside so clearly them being busy wasn't an excuse. I order a spicy chicken sandwich with mayo only, a large fry, and some nuggets. The first thing that happened was I had to repeat my order three times. Then, when I get up to the window, they try to give me someone else's order. Mine wasn't even ready. Then, when I get home, about two minutes away, the fries are already cold, and there's a shit ton of lettuce on my sandwich and no fucking mayo. Fuck this Wendy's. I'll never go again. This review is based on my drive-thru experience only - as I have never gone into the actual building at this particular location. The service is your standard \"quick and easy\" ordering for a fast food restaurant. The person handling my order seemed a bit disorganized. She tried handing me straws when I did not order any drinks and seemed confused when I told her so. She was very friendly, however, and corrected my order. I ordered a small cup of chili and fries. I have always been a big fan of their chili, however, the fries were a bit stale. This was my first time ordering here so I'll give them another try the next time. I hope the person who got my order (single cheese combo) enjoyed it more than the triple cheeseburger sandwich I got. What a disappointment. I really am disappointed. Went through the drive through late nite. I was the only person in line. The food was cold. Cold fries. Cold nuggets. Cold burger. I wish there was something better closer to home. It was depressing Old and cold. Crazy fast service because it must have been left on the grill since lunch. Nasty dry shriveled burger and cold fries as limp as my grandpa Old and cold. Crazy fast service because it must have been left on the grill since lunch. Nasty dry shriveled burger and cold fries as limp as my grandpa\n",
            "\n",
            "Went here again. Ordered inside at 7:45 on a Sunday with nobody in the place. They got both sandwiches wrong. They are incapable of making orders correctly Employees dont care what they serve. Bought 2 chocolate frostys. The Frostys were full of foam. It wasn't frozen at all. I know the employee saw it didn't look right, but it they served it anyway. I wont be going back. This location always has a huge line because they can only handle one order at a time. Tonight I waited 28 minutes to even get to the speaker,with only 4 cars in line. When I got to the speaker I watched several cars drive off while I waited to tell them I had a mobile order. Finally at the window I'm told they are out of items on my order. Of course. It's easier to go to one of the locations further from my home...it's faster!  The inside is always closed as well. This location needs better workers and management. If I could make a negative number I would. This place has the worse customer service. A few months ago I had a problem with my meal. I called and spoke to Muhammed who told me that he would write my name down and when I was in the area come back. Well since that time life happened but I stopped by today. Was needing to get a few meals. I asked for Muhammed explained what I needed and he said I don't remember talking to you? I said but you said you would write my name down. He said well when was it. I said a few months ago. He told me oh that's to long ago. After a month no we don't have. He said you didn't talk to me. Well how did I know yo ask for Muhammed. I will never spend another dollar in that store again. Customer service skills are horrible! Worst Wendy's I've ever been to. I don't know what kind of bozo they've got running this place but they're doing a piss poor job. I sat at the drive thru window for almost 10 minutes waiting on 2 cups of coffee. My food got cold before I even left the parking lot. Get your shit together Wendy's I drive here everyday. This is literally the best Wendy's. My salad is always made fresh and the customer service is splendid. The store manager is so friendly and helpful everytime I visit. 10 star service They close whenever they want, regardless of what it says online or on their doors. Pulled up to the drive thru menu and some workers were just talking in the parking lot and so I asked if they were closed...I'm assuming it was the manager (dark skin, fade, about 5 feet 9 maybe ) was like \"does it look like any lights are on to you? \" super rudely. It was 7 o clock on a Friday. I can't imagine why this place is still open. It all can't be fresh local farm to table. Sometimes and you are in a rush to get to a Bible study after work, and need something quick. Should I have packed something healthy to have on the way? Sure. But I didn't, I won't mince words. If you are American I'll make the assumption you are aware of the existence of Wendy's. Ps check out there Twitter if you haven't, it's so funny.\n",
            "Fast food is so bad for you but sometimes oh so good as a sparing treat.\n",

            "For the life of me, I'm not sure why but I really wanted one so I swung by and grabbed 2 for the road. Delicious and just what I needed. I love wendy's very much but this location is absolutely TERRIBLE! I was rushed at the window when there was obviously only 1 car behind me. I was trying to move around my cups in my car so I had room & the man decided to say \"I know you are giggling, but can we hurry it up we need to get through this line\" in a very rude tone.

They were perfectly cooked with a savory blend of spices, red onions and toasted walnuts. I would have been satisfied with more of that as an entree, but lucky for me I moved on to the apple salad with blue cheese and again it did not disappoint, a perfect balance of sweet and savory and the cucumber vinaigrette was a pleasant surprise. My bf had the beet salad and it was terrific as well. My entree was the salmon and since my bf doesn't care for sea food, I got it all to myself. He was nice enough however to let me sample his beef short ribs and they were spectacular too. I'm convinced someone in the kitchen really knows what they're doing ;)\n",

On a quiet Tuesday night we were one of 4 other tables being occupied! I knew this was a good sign for a week day! Bread was delicious with home made butter, very tasty! Mussels were delicious! Cooked perfect, not a speck of sand ( don't know why it's so hard for some places to clean their mussels, la oceana) chorizo added perfect spice and flavor to these fresh beauties! Could have eaten 2 orders with no help! The broth was delicious and I surely would have sipped from the bowl if I wanted to seem uncivilized! Lol secondly, the mussels came with spinach that is organic n was a local farm n I ate it too! The bf had the beer n brat soup! Was delicious! Again I'm not a sausage person or into beans but I loved the flavor! He just loved it! For our main courses I had the pork with home made papadelle pasta and he had the carrot and potato gnocci! We loved both of our entrees! The portions were great too! Desserts were ever better offering 2 of my favorites, bread pudding (chocolate chip flavored) and creme brûlée ( cappuccino flavored)they both were amazing and the home made ice cream! We definitely will be back! I only suggest maybe adding another pasta dish to the menu, maybe Alfredo or clams over linguini and add a few more appetizers such as mozzarella Fritta or fried calamari!
